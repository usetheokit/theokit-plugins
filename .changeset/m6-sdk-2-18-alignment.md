Align the plugin cluster to the hardened `@theokit/sdk` 2.18.0 Harness (ecosystem M6). Bumped the `@theokit/sdk` peer + dev dependency from the stale 1.x ranges (`>=1.6.0` / `>=1.0.0` / `>=1.7.0` / `npm:@theokit/sdk@next`) to `^2.18.0` / `>=2.18.0`. The consumed surface (`AuthProvider` / `AuthResult` / `OAuthTransaction` from `@theokit/sdk/server/auth`; `subscribe` for realtime) is stable across 1.x→2.x, so the alignment is a pin bump, not a migration. Also removed the phantom `@theokit/plugin-rate-limit` peer dependency from `plugin-copilot` (no such package exists; its rate-limit config is a type-only opt-in — `no-stubs-no-mocks-no-wired` clean). Validated: all 11 packages typecheck + build + test green against 2.18.0 (661 tests).
