// Orphaned-docblock gate: a JSDoc block whose next content is ANOTHER JSDoc block.
//
// TypeScript attaches a docblock to the declaration that follows it. When a second block intervenes,
// the first attaches to nothing: the symbol it was written for ships undocumented, and the text
// itself becomes invisible — present in the source, absent from every editor tooltip and from the
// published declaration. `tsc` accepts the shape without a word, which is why it accumulates.
//
// It is an editing accident, not a style choice. Two shapes produce it: a declaration MOVES to
// another module and its docblock is left behind, or a new declaration+docblock is INSERTED between
// an existing docblock and its declaration, stranding the older text.
//
// THE PATTERN'S BODY MUST NOT CONTAIN `*/`. A non-greedy `[\s\S]*?\*\/` backtracks: when the
// lookahead fails right after the first `*/`, the engine extends the body to a LATER `*/` that
// satisfies it, so every docblock matches every later docblock across whole declarations.
//
// A block at file offset 0 is a module header legitimately preceding the first symbol's docblock and
// is excluded. A header that is NOT at offset 0 still reports, correctly: it is competing for
// attachment, and the fix is to write it as a non-JSDoc comment so it stops competing.
